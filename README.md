# WebM Segments Recorder + FFmpeg Stitcher

This web app records multiple video segments in your browser,
then stitches them into a single WebM file using `ffmpeg.wasm`.

## Deployment

2. Connect your repo to Netlify using **Deploy with Git**.
3. Netlify will automatically host it as a static site.

Alternatively, drag-and-drop the root folder into [Netlify Drop](https://app.netlify.com/drop).
